# Hand Gesture Recognition Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an algorithm for recognizing hand gestures using image processing techniques. It is an exploration into the realm of computer vision and gesture recognition.

## Objectives
- Technical Objective: Master image processing for specific gesture recognition.
- Scientific Objective: Understand the principles of computer vision in gesture recognition.

## Scientific Program
### Entry and Preprocessing (Segmentation)
- RGB image capture of hand gestures.
- Conversion to YCbCr color space for better segmentation.
- ![Image 1: RGB to YCbCr Conversion](CodeProject/hands/image1.png)
- Black and white conversion and median filtering.
- ![Image 2: B&W Conversion](CodeProject/hands/image1.png)
